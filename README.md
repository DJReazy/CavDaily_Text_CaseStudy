# Cav Daily Text Analysis Case Study

## Overview
This case study explores how language differs between News and Opinion article titles from *The Cavalier Daily*. Students will use basic text analysis techniques to compare word usage patterns and determine whether these differences are statistically significant.

## Objective
The goal of this case study is to introduce students to:
- Bag-of-words text analysis
- Word frequency comparison
- Basic statistical testing (chi-square test)
- Interpreting results from real-world text data

## What You Will Do
You will analyze two datasets of article titles (News and Opinion) and:
1. Identify the most frequently used words in each group
2. Compare differences in word usage
3. Perform a chi-square test to evaluate whether these differences are significant
4. Interpret your findings in a short written report
